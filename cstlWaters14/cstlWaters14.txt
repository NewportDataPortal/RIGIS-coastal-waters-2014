    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: CT boundary was used to erase land areas leaving a matching CT coastline. The MA boundary was then used to erase land areas leaving a matching MA coastline. Data boundary was then extended past Block Island and into surrounding MA and CT coastal waters.  Added a new attibute field called 'Water,' and dissolved Esturaries_IWQMA12 dataset based on "Water = Yes."  NY shoreline boundary was then used to erase land areas leaving a matching NY coastline around Fisher Island.  Removed small NY Islands from the Coastal Water dataset by heads-up digitizing from ArcGIS Online World_Imagery.
